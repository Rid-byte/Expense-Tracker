# 💸 Expense Tracker (React – Work in Progress)

A web-based expense management system I’m building with **React** to practice component design, state management, and persistent storage.  
This project is the next step after my earlier **C++ command-line expense tracker**, now reimagined for the web.

---

## 🎯 Planned Features

- Add expenses with description, amount, category, and date  
- Display expenses in a clean, responsive UI  
- Calculate totals and monthly summaries  
- Delete or edit expenses  
- Persistent storage using **localStorage** (later upgrade to database)  
- Future scope: category filters, charts, and CSV export  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- **State Management:** React Hooks (useState, useEffect)  
- **Storage:** LocalStorage (planned upgrade to backend DB)  
- **UI:** Bootstrap / custom CSS

## 💡 Key Learnings (Expected)

- Building reusable React components  
- Managing state and props effectively  
- Handling persistent data in the browser  
- Designing responsive layouts for different devices  
- Iterating from CLI-based logic (C++) to modern web app architecture

*This project continues my journey from a C++ command-line expense tracker (linked list + file I/O) to a modern React-based web application.*
